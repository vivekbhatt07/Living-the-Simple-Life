                <h3>Simplicity and work</h3>
                <p>
                  Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated,
                  it ruins their relationship with others and it leads to
                  burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it
                  will help balance everything out.

                <h3>Simple decorations</h3>
                <p>
                  A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People
                  either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't
                  have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help
                  draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like
                  never before.
